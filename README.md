# MFA Internship Project

This repository contains the work conducted during my Master's internship.  
The objective was to apply **Multifractal Analysis (MFA)** on signals, both directly and after applying **Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD)** and **Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition (MVMD)**.  
It includes exploration notebooks, original and optimized versions of VMD and MVMD code, and testing scripts.
